Electricity:
  Current and Charge:
    Current:
      - Rate of flow of charge (rate of flow of electrons)
    Charge Flow:
      - The number of electrons
    Equation:
      - Q = I * t
      - charge (C) = current (A) * time (s)
      - current (A) = charge (C) / time (s)
  Circuit Symbols:
    - Battery
    - Cell
    - Switch
